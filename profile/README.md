   - Container and Kubernetes security scanning

3. **Multi-Cloud Landing Zone**
   - AWS and GCP infrastructure management
   - Network architecture and security controls
   - Database and Kubernetes infrastructure

4. **Kubernetes Platform (KubeLaunch)**
   - Complete platform infrastructure
   - Service mesh and observability
   - GitOps and automation tools
